  <summary>Making new apps</summary>
    
Fork this repository, create a new app under the `Apps` directory.<br />
Now, let's populate the folder with the files we need.


üìÇ yourapp<br>
‚îî üìù app.json

    
This file is your entry for describing the functionality of this app.
  - It works by extending the popular `docker-compose` format.
  - Auto-completion and intelisense is provided by a json schema, almost every field has a description on hover if you need it.
  - Every file path specified is relative to itself (ex: `metadata/icons.png` = `Apps/<myappname>/icon.png`)

Your `App` property describes how the app should behave on the front-end.<br>
- The `directory` property will be automatically filled for you when running the validation script or by husky when commiting.  
- The Icon property: [click here](https://www.figma.com/file/Z2ITlEF1MDClLfaClekQ8x/HyperOS?node-id=14%3A3) To access our figma file with the icon template and many alredy-made icons.<br> Like everything else on your app, the icon path is relative to app.json.

<br />
    
üìÇ yourapp<br>
‚îî üìÇ metadata<br>
¬†¬†¬†‚îî üìù app.md

This file is displayed on your app page under HyperOS web interface, it should contains a more detailed description about your app and what it does

HyperOS parses some extra tags to better fit the appStore:

 - `<Gallery> </Gallery>` The gallery tag accepts multiple images as content, drawing the horizontal image slide (usually shown as first element on appstore)
 - `<Image appId="myapp" path="metadata/screenshot.jpg"/>` Image requires the appId and image path as props, path is relative to app.json

  <summary>Issues / Requesting new apps</summary>

Feel free to open issues requesting new apps, bare in mind the official repository has few rules that every app must fit:

- Applications directly related to porn are not allowed.
- Crypto mining related applications are not allowed, you might wanna look at [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/).

</details>
    
### Pull requests

- Icons must have same look-and-feel.
- Non nullable environment variables must have a description.
- Nullable environmet variables may have an empty string as value.
- Unless required to function, apps should use the `/hypros` directory for volume bindings
- Make sure your app has the needed metadata.


Your app is validated before you commit by Husky.
Use the provided PR template whenever it's possible.
You can manually validate your app to check if everything is going well by running `npm run validate` or `yarn validate` (remember to install dependencies first)
