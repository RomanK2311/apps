Plex organizes video, music and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices.

## A Single Library Means Easy Sharing

Adding an App to your Plex setup is simple. Install the App, launch it and watch as it discovers any Plex Servers on the network. The Server sends the App details about your media library, ready for you to watch. The nice thing about this process is that with the Server installed and running, you don’t have to do anything more than that. It literally takes seconds to get an App up and playing media.

## Centralized Management

Having all your media housed by a central Server means you have a single place to manage your media collection. You might have some new movies to add, or don’t like the poster image being used for your favorite TV Show. Every aspect of the Server is managed by the Plex Web App. It runs in a web browser from anywhere in your home, so you don’t have to be at a particular computer to manage your library. Once a change is made, it’s immediately available to all the Apps in your home without having to do anything extra.

## Plex Pass
With a Plex Pass subscription, you can do even more. First off, there are loads of premium features—set up a DVR to watch and record over-the-air content with a tuner & antenna, sync media to your mobile device for offline access, and get early access and discounts on various things. You also get audio enhancements, parental controls, and much more.
